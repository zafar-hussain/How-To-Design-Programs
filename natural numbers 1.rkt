; ; ; Exercise 11.2.1 Generalize hellos to repeat, which consumes a natural number n and a symbol
; ; ; and produces a list with n occurrences of the symbol.
; ; symbol - n - times:n (number)s (symbol) -  > listOfSymbols
; ; returns a listOfSymbols, with symbol repeated n times;

; Examples

(check-expect (symbol-n-times 0 'aSymbol) empty) ; basecase
(check-expect (symbol-n-times 1 'aSymbol)(cons 'aSymbol empty))
(check-expect (symbol-n-times 3 'test)(list 'test 'test 'test))

;;; for some natural numbers. Specifically, it consumes a natural number n and produces a list of nposns.
;;; The first one combines n with (f n), the second one n-1 with (f n-1), etc.

;;; Exercise 11.2.3 Develop apply-n. The function consumes a natural number, n. It applies the
;;; function move from exercise 10.3.6 n times to FACE, the list of shapes from exercise 10.3.1.
;;; Each application should translate the shape by one pixel. The purpose of the function is to
;;; simulate a continuously moving shape on a canvas, the last missing piece of the extended
;;; exercise 10.3.

;;; Exercise 11.2.4 Lists may contain lists that contain lists and so on. Here is a data definition that
;;; takes this idea to an extreme:
;;; A deep-list is either
;;; 1. s where s is some symbol or
;;; 2. (cons dl empty), where dl is a deep list.
;;; Develop the function depth, which consumes a deep list and determines how many times cons
;;; was used to construct it.
;;; Develop the function make-deep, which consumes a symbol s and a natural number and
;;; produces a deep list containing s and constructed with n conses.
