;Modeling a Ball on a Table..
;
;1. A ball is a structure with four fields: the current position and the velocity in each direction.
;That is, the first two numbers in a ball structure are the current position on the canvas,
;andthe next two numbers describe how far the ball moves in the two directions per step.

;; ball -> define-struct (x      y      delta-x delta-y)
;;                        number number number  number

(define-struct ball (x y delta-x delta-y))



;2. The function move-ball models the physical movement of the ball. It consumes a ball and
;creates a new one, modeling one step.

;; move-ball : ball -> ball

(define (move-ball aBall)
  (make-ball ((+ (ball-x aBall) (ball-delta-x aBall))
              (+ (ball-y aBall) (ball-delta-y aBall))
              (ball-delta-x aBall)
              (ball-delta-y aBall))))
             
;3. The function draw-and-clear draws the ball at its current position, then waits for a short
;time, and clears it again.

;; draw-and-clear -> boolean

(define (draw-and-clear aBall)
  (local ((define ball-posn (make-posn ((ball-x aBall) (ball-y aBall)))))
    (and
     (draw-solid-disk ball-posn 10 'red)
     (sleep-for-a-while 3)
     (clear-solid-disk ball-posn 10 'red)
     )))

;4. out-of-bounds?, a function that determines whether a given ball is
;still visible on the canvas:

(define WIDTH  300)
(define HEIGHT 300)

  
;;out-of-bounds? : a-ball → boolean
;; to determine whether a-ball is outside of the bounds
;; domain knowledge, geometry
(define (out-of-bounds? aBall)
  (not
   (and
    (<= 0 (ball-x aBall) WIDTH)
    (<= 0 (ball-y aBall) HEIGHT))))

;; move-until-out: a-ball → true
;; to model the movement of a ball until it goes out of bounds
(define (move-until-out aBall)
  (cond
    [(out-of-bounds? aBall) true]
    [else
     (and
      (draw-and-clear aBall)
      (move-until-out (move-ball aBall)))]))

(start WIDTH HEIGHT)
(move-until-out (make-ball 10 10 2 2))
